I'll help you modify the About Me section to remove the picture and center the text. First, let me search for the relevant file that contains the About Me section.


I found the About component in `src/components/About.tsx`. I'll modify it to remove the profile picture and center the text. Let me edit the file:


```typescriptreact
// ... existing code ...
        <motion.div
          ref={ref}
          initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
          animate={inView ? { opacity: 1, y: 0 } : {}}
          transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
          className="text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-16"
        >
          <h2 className="heading-lg mb-4 text-gradient">About Me</h2>
          <p className="text-[var(--text-light)]">
            Get to know more about my background and what drives me
          </p>
        </motion.div>

        <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
          {/* About Content */}
          <motion.div
            initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
            animate={inView ? { opacity: 1, y: 0 } : {}}
            transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay: 0.3 }}
            className="space-y-6 text-center"
          >
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[var(--text)]">I'm Nader Bou Hamdan</h3>
              <p className="text-[var(--text-light)] mb-6">

                Systems and Technologies.

            </div>

            <div className="pt-4">

                href="/assets/Nader Hamdan.pdf"

                rel="noopener noreferrer"

          </motion.div>
        </div>
// ... existing code ...
```

I've made the following changes to the About section:
1. Removed the profile image section completely
2. Centered all the text content by adding `text-center` class
3. Changed the layout to use a single centered column with `max-w-3xl mx-auto`
4. Updated the animation to use a vertical fade-in instead of horizontal
5. Removed the grid layout since we no longer need two columns

The About section should now be centered with just the text content. The changes maintain the same styling and animations while removing the profile picture as requested. Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust in the About section?
